<p>I have to say that this project is way too ambitious. I hope to keep updating it little by little (to the end). The current popular areas in seismology may seem very different to what the advanced topics look like in this famous book <em>Quantitative Seismology</em> by Aki and Richards (and many other classic textbooks). However, the discipline originates from these foundations, and I would like to pay homage to our great seismologists.</p>
