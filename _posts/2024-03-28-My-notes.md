<p>This post summarizes <strong>my own</strong> class notes and lectures. No official course materials are included here.</p>

<p>The classes I took notes were taught on the boards and no lecture notes were provided from the instructors (in a sense, requiring us to summarize the materials, which is great). I also post some of my lectures for TA requirement and seminar presentations below, which I thought (based on feedbacks) should be of OK quality.</p>
