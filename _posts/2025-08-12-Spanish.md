<p>¡Aprender español me hace sentir feliz!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Notes for Spanish course
  [ <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/_data/files/Spanish/Modern_Spanish/index.html" target="_blank">HTML</a> ]. The course is in Chinese, and the textbooks are called &laquo;Español Moderno&raquo;, the ones used by undergraduates majored in Spanish.</li>
  <li>Transcripts of Duolingo listening podcasts
  [ <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/_data/files/Spanish/Duolingo/index.html" target="_blank">HTML</a> ]. There are, of course, mixed opinions on the effectiveness of Duolingo for language learning, but I actually found those listening podcasts pretty great: Suitable speed, useful topics, different voices and tones, increasing levels of grammars and vocabularies. The transcripts are not provided, so I use those podcasts for dictation and reading along.</li>
  <li>Short stories
  [ <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/_data/files/Spanish/Historias.html" target="_blank">HTML</a> ]. My Spanish writing practices. I did self-check with ChatGPT, but definitely there are still more to improve.</li>
