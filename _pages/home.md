I am Qing Ji, a PhD student in Geophysics at <a href="https://geophysics.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford University</a>. I received a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Geophysics from <a href="https://www.geophy.pku.edu.cn/index.htm" target="_blank">Peking University</a> in 2020. My current research is focused on seismic ambient noise generated by atmospheric turbulence during hurricane landfall events. I aim at contributing to an inter-disciplinary workflow to better interpret and leverage these seismic ambient noise signals from the atmosphere. My work integrates seismic and atmospheric data for observational analysis, and more importantly, combines turbulence simulation with seismic modeling to investigate the generation mechanisms of these signals.<br/>

Other topics of my previous works include: Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technique for urban subsurface imaging using surface Rayleigh and Love waves; Global seismic waveform modeling in 3-D Earth's model to study the influence of mantle heterogeneity on outermost outer core seismic phases.
