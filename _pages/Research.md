  <center><h3>Seismic ambient noise from atmospheric turbulence</h3></center>
  <p>While secondary and primary microseisms originating from ocean waves are more widely known as contributing to the seismic ambient noise wavefield, atmospheric pressure fluctuations can also contribute to the noise spectrum. An extreme scenario is the hurricane landfall: Hurricane Isaac in 2012, which landfalls at Louisiana coast, is a great case study to investigate this type of noise signals. There were seismic stations witnessing the passage of Isaac and recording what happened within the fierce eyewall.</p>
  <p>Very different from microseisms which compose of seismic surface waves, this atmosphere-ground coupling is local quasi-static. Using realistic surface pressure fluctuations from large-eddy simulation (LES) of turbulence, I perform seismic modeling to interpret the observed seismic imprints. Inter-disciplinary approaches bridging seismic observation and modeling together with atmospherc sciences are crucial to decipher the nature of this type of ambient noise, lay the foundation for exploiting these signals for inversion of shallow subsurface structures, and further study the atmosphere-ground couplings under other environments and scenarios.</p>
